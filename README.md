# HDDS_FCSN_Mode_Experiments

The repository shows the results of the mode experiments the mVAM team conducted in Mozambique. 

In particular, we wanted to validate the HDDS and FSC-N indicators collected in Mozambique to ensure their suitability with the mVAM data collection methods. 

The repository includes for each indicator tested: datasets, R scripts and paper

#For the HDDS indicator it was checked:
1. which approach between List-based and open-based is more feasible to collect HDDS and could provide results comparable with the F2F surveys;
2. differences in the deographic characteristics among the CATI and F2F samples
3. differences in the HDDS scores between data collected using CATI and F2F.

#For the FCS-N indicator :
1. it was checked if same respondents change their answers when the same demographic questions are asked on two different days. Then, for the same group of respondents, we compare the FCS-N indicator to see if the score changes when the recall period is changed from 24 hours to seven days. 
2. We compare the FCS-N indicator among SMS respondents who replied to the FCS-N for seven consecutive days using a 24-hour recall period (Group-A 24H) with the results yielded from SMS respondents who replied to the FCS-N on Day eight, using the seven-dayrecall period (Group-B seven days).
3. We compare the FCS-N answers provided by SMS respondents who replied to the FCS-N for seven consecutive days with a 24-hour recall period (Group-A 24H) against the results yielded from the  F2F respondents (F2F seven days).
4. Before comparing the FCS-N answers, we check if the groups (Group-A 24H, Group-B seven days and F2F seven days) are similar in terms of demographics.
